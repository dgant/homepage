		<h1>Project STAY Game (2004)</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			In 2004, I lead a group of student engineers under the Columbia Service-Learning Program (CSLP). We were assigned to begin development of an educational game for the website of the Project STAY HIV clinic in Harlem. The clinic reported that patients often failed to take their medications, and asked us to develop a game that would convey to patients the importance of taking medications regularly.

			After researching the complexities of HIV medication regimens, and talking to patients about their video gaming experience, we set about developing the game. With a very limited timeframe in which to conduct our research and design the game, we were only expected to produce a design document for another student team to implement. However, our team completed the design with two weeks to spare. Myself and a teammate spent two weeks procuring and learning Macromedia Director MX. My teammate coded a pre-loader and implemented a radar feature, while I implemented the game physics, graphics, player controls, and soundtrack. We finished within our deadline with a digital prototype and a development plan for our successors to finish the implementation.

			Background
		</h2>
		<p>
			In the months after the King departed on a military expedition, his realm was gripped by fear and unrest. Sheriff Ailus, to whom the King entrusted custody of his throne, proved callous and corrupt. With the backing of the greedy nobility, the vile Sheriff passed outlandish taxes and implemented widespread graft, depriving the peasantry of their meager holdings.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the fortunes of the proletariat dwindled with each new levy and decree, the most desperate and downtrodden sought their fortune in daring raids on merchants' convoys and landlords' estates. Rumors quickly spread of these secretive bands of thieves, and their ever-bolder challenges to royal authority. Despite the heroic exploits of these outlaws, most folks yearned for the peace and prosperity that would surely return with the arrival of their wise and benevolent King.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, on the first anniversary of the Sheriff's ascension, news spread around the kingdom like a wildfire: the King's armies had been defeated, and their leader slain. The masses despaired at the realization that there would be no end to the despotic rule of Sheriff Ailus. With no hope of relief in sight, many of those who had tolerated poverty and tyranny under the Sheriff now sought to join the roving bands of thieves.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the leader of an ever-growing party of bandits, you must find a way to survive in these dark and desperate times. Will the nobility cower at your fearsome domination over their estates and trade routes? Will you seek to monopolize your control over the villages and woodlands by conquering and assimilating other renegades? Or will one of your rivals get the better of you, relegating you to the miserable destitution from whence you came?

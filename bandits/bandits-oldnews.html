			<b>February 1, 2008</b><br>
			Check out <i>Bandits</i> Beta 9.0, featuring the last changes related to the modified victory conditions. Barring any major bugs, Beta 9.1 will be followed by the final 1.0 release!
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>January 21, 2008</b><br>
			<i>Bandits</i> <a href="bandits-play.html">Beta 8.4</a> brings a number of requested changes. Some highlights:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The gold accumulation victory condition has been completely removed. Almost all the mechanics that supported it now apply to the town accumulation victory condition. This includes the Mastermind's Stalk and Deceive abilities, NPC Villages' attack preferences, and unit costs.</li>
			<li>A display has been added that makes it easier for players to see how many towns they have occupied.</li>
			<li>The Sheriff's abilities have been revamped to increase his overall strength while reducing his dependence on permabashing.</li>
			<li>Thieves now have a "Pawn Items" ability that allows them to quickly sell off their inventory, making item scavenging much easier.</li>
			<li>The Mastermind's Deceive ability now affects the judgements of the Villages (Making them more likely to attack Deceive's target). Thanks to playtester Kai_Okarian for the idea.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The new version and changelog are, as always, available on the <a href="bandits-play.html">playtest page</a>.
